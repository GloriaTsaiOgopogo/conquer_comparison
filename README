$ make

To add a method, construct a script in the form of the "apply_*.R" scripts (in the scripts/ directory), where * should be the name of the method. Then add the name of the method to the makefile

To add a dataset, put the rds file containing the MultiArrayExperiment in the data/ folder and construct a script in the form of the "generate_config_*.R" scripts (in the scripts/ directory), where * should be the name of the dataset. Then add the name of the dataset to the makefile.
